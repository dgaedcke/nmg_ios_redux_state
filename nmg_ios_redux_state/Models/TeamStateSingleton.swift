/*
	keeps track of Game/Team state
	should also dispatch notifications when tradability changes for a team

team is tradable under following conditions:
	1) game in which they are scheduled is marked tradable
2) they WON previous game and next game is either:
	missing OR NOT YET tradable (this is the liquidation sale scenario)
those are the only two conditions!!!

TeamStateMgr is the only public access point thru:
	updateState() -> nil
	isTradable() -> Bool

Notifications (only upon state change) should be:
TeamIsTradable
TeamIsClosed
TeamIsLiquidatable (sell in quiet period)
TeamIsWorthless

GameProgress (private) is just a wrapper around the game record
TeamGameTree (private) is a teamID & list of GameProgress
TeamStateMgr is the singleton that keeps track of all this state
